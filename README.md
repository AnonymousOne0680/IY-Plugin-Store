## Usage

The loader allows Infinite Store to always be kept up-to-date without re-downloading it every time you want to use it.\
You can download the Infinite Store loader directly [here](https://github.com/Infinite-Store/Infinite-Store/releases/latest/download/is.luau), or use one of these `loadstring()` loaders:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://load.epik.ml/store.lua"))()
```

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://infinite-store.ml/main.lua"))()
```

## Important Information

If you want to know how to install plugins, or where to get even more information, please refer to the [Infinite Store Wiki](https://github.com/Infinite-Store/Infinite-Store/wiki).\
For even more help, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dubhsUGcZe) server!

## Contributions

Do you have your own plugin or want to update existing ones? You can do it by creating a fork and committing your files. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/Infinite-Store/Infinite-Store/compare) to get your changes accepted (compare across forks to select your fork).\
You may also open a pull request to add your plugin URLs from a source repository other than this one.
